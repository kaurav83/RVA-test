## Details

To implement the login form, I followed the concept of uncontrolled components, using a combination of the react-hook-form and mui libraries.

I tried to move all the logic out of the components into the custom hooks, and then use the required functions from the hooks inside the component.

Layout according to BEM methodology

Also used Redux and Redux-Thunk for some cases.

Completed all the tasks according to the test assignment.
